phpCollab 3.0
===

This is the future home of the next iteration of phpCollab. This repo's master branch is intentionally left empty to prevent people from trying to install non-working code.

If you'd like to keep tabs on the development, or better yet help out, all work is currently being done in the [develop branch](https://github.com/phpcollab/phpcollab/tree/develop).
